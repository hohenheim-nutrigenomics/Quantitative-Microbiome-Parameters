These scripts were used to conduct all data analyses reported in the publication: "Similar quantitative gut microbiome modulation and intestinal anti-inflammatory response to high-fiber diet and time-restricted feeding"

The gut microbiome has been widely implicated in various human disorders but reported fecal taxonomic microbiota associations are frequently inconsistent between studies, cohorts, and interventions. Here, a food dye-based gastrointestinal (GI) passage assay was expanded to measure quantitative gut microbiome parameters (QMPs), including fecal mass, microbial load, and microbiota excretion. QMPs were strongly modulated by diet, feeding pattern, and IL-10 deficiency, reflecting changes in food intake and gastrointestinal transit. Microbiota excretion emerged as an integrative parameter determined by fecal mass and microbial load, with microbial load itself positively associated with GI transit time. High-fiber diet (HFiD) and time-restricted feeding (TRF) induced convergent reductions in microbial load, microbiota excretion, and transit time, whereas high-fat diet (HFaD) produced opposing effects. These QMP changes were associated with overlapping intestinal gene expression signatures, consistent with anti-inflammatory effects of HFiD and TRF, indicating relevance for host physiology. In contrast, fecal taxonomic microbiota profiles were dominated by ecological and experimental confounders, showing limited reproducibility across studies. Shared QMP and gene expression responses to distinct diet and feeding interventions may therefore reflect taxonomy-independent host-microbiome interactions that could explain previously reported inconsistencies and suggest QMP utility as diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets for microbiome-mediated diseases.
